Repository to utilize GoogleMaps APIs.

Google offers geographical and locational information through GoogleMaps APIs. The documentation provided online is thorough (see here for more: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/), and there are several example programs scattered online. 

This repository was developed simply to make batch programs accessible and commented for users.

GoogleMaps APIs are quota-restricted through API keys.
